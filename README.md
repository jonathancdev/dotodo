## Lessons Learned

I built this application for two reasons. The first was to practice using a styled component library and I chose to work with Chakra UI. The second reason I built this was to learn how to implement a BaaS to handle authentication and the database. In previous applications I had built my own simple authentication and saved data to localstorage, so I learned a lot using Firebase to handle authentication and storage.
